# Visual-Algorithms: A Fun Way to See Sorting in Action
Visual-Algorithms is an interactive web application that helps you understand how different sorting algorithms work. Built with React and styled with the Carbon Design System, this project provides a clean and intuitive interface for learning and experimenting with sorting techniques.

# Key Features
Interactive Visualizations: Watch algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more reorder arrays in real-time.

Algorithm Switching: Instantly change between algorithms to compare their efficiency and behavior.

Customizable Controls: Adjust array size, playback speed, and randomness to test different scenarios.

Step-by-Step Execution: Pause, step forward, or resume the algorithm to closely analyze each operation.

Statistics Panel: Track steps, comparisons, array accesses, and complexity in real-time.

# Technologies Used
React: The core framework for building the interactive UI.

Carbon Design System: Provides accessible, consistent, and elegant styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): Implements the sorting algorithms and visualization logic.

# Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to run the project locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/visual-algorithms.git

Navigate into the project directory:

cd visual-algorithms

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm start

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000/.
